## Description

_A website that allows users to post ideas for projects, products, or charitable acts, and to request funding._

## Specifications

* As a user, I want to see all fundrusing ideas
* As a user, I want to see categories: products, projects, and charitable acts that are seeking funding.
* As a user, I want to select a category to view a page containing all projects in that category.
* As a user, I want to click a project to see more details: 
 - name
 - project starters/managers
 - description
 - amount of money the project is hoping to raise
 - amount of money already risen

Further features:
* As a user, I want to be able to filter projects as I browse them. Perhaps by the amount of funding they still require.
* As a user, I want to click a button or fill out a form to fund a project.
* As a user, I want the option to post my own project or charitable act that seeks funding.
* As an administrator, I want to add, update, or delete projects as necessary. (User authentication is not required).
* Things like charitable acts might have different types of properties/details than companies seeking startup funding, too.
